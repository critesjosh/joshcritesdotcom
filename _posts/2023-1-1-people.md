People are the most creative, adaptable, capable thing in the universe (that we know about). More peaceful people that are playing *the* infinite game are good. See education

Make the infinite game even better. More players.

Increase the complexity of the universe. More connections, more interactions, more creativity.

Why would you not want more of them?
