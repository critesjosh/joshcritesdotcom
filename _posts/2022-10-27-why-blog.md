I am starting a blog. Why?

***To nurture emergence of increasingly complex holons.***

This is my guiding principle and it has served me well--I attribute much of my recent happiness and satisfaction with life to following this. I want to share this perspective with other people while continuing down this path--these two things are complementary aspects of the same principle.

Let's unpack this a bit more.

## What is a holon?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) "A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole."

This comes directly from the writings of [Ken Wilber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber), the originator of [Integral Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)). Integral Theory and the concept of of the holon accurately capture the fractal nature of the world and the human's place within it. This is helpful when considering claims about the nature of the world and our place within it.

It is also helpful when trying to understand general trends in the history of the universe. There seems to be a general trend of increasing complexity through the history of the universe. Integral Theory has a lot to say about this and the concept of holons and their development and emergence are central to this theory.

In short, as time progresses, novel, increasingly complex holons tend to emerge.

## What does increasingly complex mean?

Holons emerge in hierarchies, new holons are built from existing holons. As Ken Wilber might say, new holons "transcend and include" existing holons. The new ones create larger, more inclusive wholes of which existing holons become a part. Think about how multicellular organisms emerged by incorporating existing single cellular organisms into a larger more efficient symbiotic unit. Note that multicellular organisms didn't replace single cellular ones, they created and filled new niches by being functionally differentiated. These new multicellular holons are deeper within and inclusive of the nested hierarchy of extant holons. They include more holons within their boundaries and are thus more complex.

An feature of Integral Theory that is largely missing from the current common understanding of science is the emphasis of an internal and external aspect of a holon. Science today is primarily concerned with external aspects. External experiences are those which are measurable and communicable. It is what a holon looks (sounds, feels, etc) like from the outside. Contrast this with internal aspects, which can only be known by an individual instance of a holon--what does it feel like to be a bat? What does it feel like to be you?

When you burn your hand in a fire, there are things that can be measured about the event--the temperature of the skin on your hand, the flow of blood to the injured area, how quickly you pull your hand away from the heat, how loudly you scream when you notice, etc. This is experiencing the event from the outside. There is also a subjective experience of what it feels like to burn your hand--searing pain, the rhythmic throbbing, sensitivity to touch, etc. This is the experience from within.

If all holons have external and internal experiences, it may appear that Integral Theory is advocating for a sort of [panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism). In some sense this may be true in that much more of the world is actually experiencing than is traditionally thought, but 

### Choice

Not all complex holons are worth nurturing. Most holons will collapse under their own complexity. Novelty isn't stable by default.

This is probably most familiarly demonstrated by biological evolution. Most of the species that have ever evolved have gone extinct.

To most effectively nurture the emergence of increasingly complex holons, I should nurture those holons which have the greatest likelihood of persisting into the future and not falling apart and going extinct.

At the social/political level, this may be most familiar from the global conflict of the 20th century. Fascism as a social organizing principle was bested by communism with the Soviets and capitalist democracy from the West. Communism subsequently collapsed and is no longer considered a valid organizing principle for States.

This carries forward into the global digital technologies that we are collectively building. It is apparent to many that the current incentive mechanisms associated with Big Tech are not sustainable. Big Tech generally destabilizes the structures on which they depend (capitalism and liberal democracy).

This is a big reason for why I have been personally focused on web3.

## How does a blog nurture complexity?

A key feature of the emergence of this new tech layer is connectivity and collaboration. This blog directly supports these features. I hope it will serve as a reference point for ideas a

This guiding principle implies that I am simultaneously an emergent process of the world and a steward of the universal process that created me. Importantly, this perspective helps me orient myself in the world by making claims about my origin and purpose. Without this orienting
