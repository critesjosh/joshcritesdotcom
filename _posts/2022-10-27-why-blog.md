I started a blog. Why?

My stated personal mission is to:

| *nuture emergence of increasingly complex holons.*

## What is a holon?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) "A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole."

This comes directly from the writings of [Ken Wilber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber), the originator of [Integral Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)). Integral Theory and the concept of of the holon accurately capture the fractal nature of the world and the human's place within it.

As the universe evolves, new holons emerge.

## What do deep and meaningful mean?

Holons emerge in hierarchies, new holons from existing holons. These new holons are deeper within the nested hierarchy of extant holons. They include more holons within their wholes and are more complex.

Not all complex holons are worth nurturing. Some complex holon will collapse under their own complexity. Novelty isn't stable by default.
